# Mushroom Edible - Poison Classification

This project focuses on classifying mushrooms into poisonous or edible categories using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies whether a mushroom is poisonous based on its characteristics.

## Overview

Mushroom poisoning is a serious concern, and accurate classification of mushrooms can help prevent accidental ingestion of poisonous species. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze mushroom features and predict their toxicity level. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various attributes of mushrooms, such as cap shape, cap color, odor, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Mushroom dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about different mushroom species, including their classification as either poisonous or edible. The dataset is available in the Dataset folder.

## Classification methods used:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization

#### The distribution of data in various features in the dataset can be understood from the following visualization.

## Model Evaluation

The classification model is evaluated based on various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are presented in the notebook/script and can help assess the model's effectiveness in classifying mushrooms.
